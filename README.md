# WEEK 1
We introduced cyber trust and taught detailed information.
* Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.
·         Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
·         Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.
·         Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.
·         Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
·         Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.
·         End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.

* Different types of attacks found in bussines;*
* Malware can close computer networks. The British National Health System (NHS) was recently hit by a ransomware (WannaCry) which disabled access to their information system (Smart, 2018). An example of a ransomware is WannaCry. Spyware, ransomware and adware aren’t really interchangeable – they’re all flavours of malware rather than equivalents 
* Phishing When a user clicks on the advert, the links could give access to a hidden process which would lead to personal data being stolen.
 *Denial of service* This is done by a system flooding the targeted network or website with request traffic until it is unable to respond or crashes. 
* APT The intention is to stay hidden in the network for a long period of time to understand operations and key areas of data storage. It is believed that these types of attacks are often state-sponsored.


# Week 2
As part of my work on Scanning Activities, I became familiar with the syntax and functionality of these commands.

•	tracet
•	ing
•	nslookup
•	whois
•	ipconfig
•	nmap


In order to execute these commands, I discovered, we must first install certain packages in order to execute them in the windows command prompt. I also had the opportunity to execute them in the terminal on a Linux machine. Finally, I report on the scanning activity as a whole, including the challenges I encountered and how I overcame them.

# WEEK 3-4
During weeks 3 and 4, I focused my study on the Cyber Kill Chain. I did some study on the seven phases that make up this concept

* What is The Cyber Kill Chain?
The cyber death chain is a paradigm that outlines the processes an attacker takes during a cyber assault, from early surveillance to achieving their objectives. It includes reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and activities on targets. Understanding the cyber death chain may aid in the development of tactics for detecting and preventing assaults at different levels...

* Worst-case scenario cyberattack:

The SolarWinds breach was a nightmare come true for many businesses and people. It was especially frightening that the assault remained undiscovered for so long, since it provided the hackers sufficient opportunity to access the networks of some of the best-protected businesses in the world and steal important data. As a result of gaining access to critical government networks and data, the hack had far-reaching repercussions and had grave national security ramifications...

# WEEK 4-5
We entered Kali Linux and started to learn Kali Linux.

* What is Kali Linux ?

Kali Linux (formerly known as BackTrack Linux) is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. It does this by providing common tools, configurations, and automations which allows the user to focus on the task that needs to be completed, not the surrounding activity.
Kali Linux contains industry specific modifications as well as several hundred tools targeted towards various Information Security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security Research, Computer Forensics, Reverse Engineering, Vulnerability Management and Red Team Testing.
Kali Linux is a multi-platform solution, accessible and freely available to information security professionals and hobbyists.



# WEEK  5-6

During Weeks 5-6, I learned about and practiced defenses against Denial of Service (DoS), Honeypot,Maltego,Shodan, and Port Security,Wıreshark capture


* Denial of service (DoS) attack:

A Denial of Service (DoS) assault is a form of cyberattack designed to render a computer or network resource inaccessible to its intended users.
DoS attacks may be launched using a single or several devices, and they can target a particular service or the whole network.
DoS attacks may be very disruptive and inflict significant damage to persons and organizations by denying access to vital services.
It is essential to employ security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and load balancers to guard against DoS assaults.
DoS assaults are unlawful and immoral, and it is essential to respect the rights and privacy of others while using the Internet...



* What is Port Security?

Point security refers to a security system intended to defend a particular area or point of access.
Port security is a security mechanism intended to safeguard ports and other maritime facilities from security threats.
Point security and port security both use physical barriers, security personnel, and security technologies to prevent unwanted entry and maintain the safety and security of people and goods.



* What is a honeypot?

A honeypot is a network-connected machine that is designed to behave as a decoy, drawing in prospective attackers to disclose their harmful activities and giving organizations the chance to watch and follow them...



* What is Maltego?

Maltego is a comprehensive tool for graphical link analyses that offers real-time data mining and information gathering, as well as the representation of this information on a node-based graph, making patterns and multiple order connections between said information easily identifiable.
With Maltego, you can easily mine data from dispersed sources, automatically merge matching information in one graph, and visually map it to explore your data landscape.
Maltego offers the ability to easily connect data and functionalities from diverse sources using Transforms. Via the Transform Hub, you can connect data from over 80 data partners, a variety of public sources (OSINT) as well as your own data.



* What is Shodan?


Shodan is a search engine that lets users search for various types of servers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet using a variety of filters. Some have also described it as a search engine of service banners, which are metadata that the server sends back to the client.



* What is Wireshark in Kali?

Wireshark is a network “sniffer” - a tool that captures and analyzes packets off the wire. Wireshark can decode too many protocols to list here. This package provides idl2wrs and other files necessary for developing new packet dissectors.

# WEEK 6-7
* What is the man in the middle attack? (MITM)

An attack known as a "man-in-the-middle" (MITM) occurs when a hacker intercepts communication between two parties and poses as one of them to the other. By deceiving the participants into believing they are speaking directly to one another, the attacker is able to view the conversation and perhaps change it. MITM attacks may be difficult to identify and stop, and if they are successful, they might have detrimental effects. Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS and take further precautions such using strong passwords and two-factor authentication, being careful when connecting to untrusted networks or devices, utilizing a firewall and antivirus software to guard against MITM attacks.

# WEEK 8-9
* Greenhouse Infrastructure in IoT

In the context of a greenhouse, the term "IoT infrastructure" refers to the network of sensors, networking devices, and other hardware and software components that are used to monitor and manage the environment of the greenhouse. Collecting data on various parameters within a greenhouse, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity, and utilizing this data to control the environment within the greenhouse is the primary objective of an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure designed for greenhouses, with the end goal of maximizing plant growth while simultaneously minimizing energy use...
